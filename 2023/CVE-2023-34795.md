This vulnerability affects from v0.1.2 to v0.2.34 and will be patched in v0.2.35.

## Impact

 Denial of Service and potentially Remote Code Execution

## Description

A free of uninitialized pointer vulnerability was discovered in `xlsxioread_sheetlist_close()` which may lead to freeing arbitrary pointers. It can be triggered by a malformed XLSX file, allowing remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing program or potentially a Remote Code Execution (RCE) by hijacking function pointers.
